## Game of Chance

**A transparent and secure lottery system built on Ethereum using Solidity and the Foundry framework. This project leverages Chainlink VRF for verifiable and tamper-proof random number generation, ensuring fairness and trustlessness.**

## Features

### Smart Contract Lottery

Participate in a decentralized lottery system where all rules and transactions are governed by transparent and immutable smart contracts. The lottery ensures fairness by automating the entire process, from ticket purchases to winner selection, without the need for intermediaries. Built on Ethereum, this system provides a trustless and secure environment for users to engage in the lottery.

### Chainlink VRF

The lottery leverages Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to generate tamper-proof and verifiable random numbers, ensuring complete fairness in winner selection. Chainlink VRF provides cryptographic proof that the randomness is unbiased and cannot be manipulated by any party. This integration guarantees trust and transparency, making the lottery truly decentralized and reliable
